I did the [checkout exercise](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/process_review/exercises/checkout) again

First commit is here: <https://github.com/Hives/makers-process-reviews/commit/7fced722cd2329cdcaf1932694e9c109757cbc5e>

## My reflection

See also reflections on previous attempts at this exercise - [1st attempt](../02-checkout), [2nd attempt](../03-checkout)


- Better than previous ones I think
- Still ran out of time - further refactoring I could have done.
- My guard clauses pass the acceptance tests, but they don't protect against all bad input. Ran out of time though.
- Quite a big change in [this commit](https://github.com/Hives/makers-process-reviews/commit/ccd365d5a363c76d4feba50a929113a093384308) is that OK?
- Are the commit messages appropriate?
