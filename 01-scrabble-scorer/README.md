# First process review - scrabble score
*Date: Wed 13 Mar 2019*

I managed to record the wrong screen when I was working on the exercise, so there's no video :(

I did the ['scrabble score' exercise](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/process_review/exercises/scrabble_solver).

Here's Debora's feedback:

> good planning first in your notes
> 
> TDD the neeed of an argument with test raise_error -> check with a coach if it's alright. I've never seen it before. You will be taught also BDD as test behaviour not state and this test might be irrelevant and to be left out for good practise.
> 
> okay passing the first test with hardcoded 1 in the code
> 
> second failing test then implement easiest way
> 
> third failing test: implement longer if case
> 
> nice thought in expecting downcases as well in your test and protecting it in your code with .downcase for all string passed
> 
> test for words rather than single letters
> 
> tested implementation in irb to make sure of how to write your code: nice
> 
> 13:50 refactored the case statement to an hash as it was going to be a very long code: correct
> 
> 17': all tests pass after adding the full hash
> 
> great thought about refactoring a little now
> 
> keep running rspec after refactoring small bits to make sure it passes: great!
